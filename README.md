# ClickSort

ClickSort is a Bukkit plugin which makes it very easy for players to sort their inventories (player/chest/dispenser) with a single or double click of the mouse. Players can sort by item ID, item name, switch between single- and double-clicking, or disable sorting entirely, all on a per-player basis and without needing any commands; it's all done with mouse clicks in inventory windows.

## Installation

## Building
