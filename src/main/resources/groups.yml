# Adjust this as you wish to define sort groups that will be used when the
# player sort mode is GROUP.  You can add as many or as few groups as you
# please.
#
# See http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/clicksort/pages/sort-modes/#w-group
# for more information.
#
# You can use anything you like for the group names, but they are sorted
# alphabetically, so a numeric prefix as used below is recommended.
#
# You can use numeric material ID's or material names as defined in
# http://jd.bukkit.org/rb/apidocs/org/bukkit/Material.html.  You can also
# specify a data value if you want, e.g. '351:4' is a piece of a lapis.
# 
# See also the 'default_group_name' setting in config.yml for how to define
# a default group for any items not listed here.
